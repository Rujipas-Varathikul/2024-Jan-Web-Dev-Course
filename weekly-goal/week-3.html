    <h1>Hi, My name is Vetit ☺️</h1>
    <p>Data Science Student <br />>.Coder</p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>
      I have 3 years of experience on computer vision such as Medical Imaging,
      License Plate Recognition, Documents OCR, Basic Classification Problems.
      This also includes Regression Problems, Decision Trees, Future Prediction,
      Face Detection, Human-Pose Recognition etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Web development</h3>
    <p>
      My project towards Web Development are built on React As a front-end
      frameworks, Node.JS as a backend which mostly use Firebase as a Non-SQL
      Database and Web Hosting, Supabase as a SQL database, and Rest API as a
      connector between front and back.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      As next year, I am graduated from B.Sc. Data Science, I have lots of
      classwork for data analytics from variety of datasets.
